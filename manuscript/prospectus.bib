	abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. Short-circuit faults are a potential source of damage to circuitry in DC-powered systems. Industrial applications including power converters, inverters, and insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) often rely on fault detection systems in the form of dedicated circuitry to prevent damage. To increase flexibility in short-circuit detection and decrease dedicated circuitry, a software-based approach is presented. This implementation requires minimal circuitry and allows for tradeoff between board space and processor utilization. The design relies on a single inductor and microprocessor running a real-time task for identifying current and monitoring circuitry for faults. Experiments demonstrate detection of both hard-switching faults (HSF) and fault under load (FUL) shorts. The depicted relationship between processor utilization and board space consumed by the circuitry is confirmed through experimentation and allows optimization of board space with respect to utilization and vice versa. As a result, the proposed software-based detection is implementable with the addition of a single component and protects against damage from both HSF and FUL shorts.},

	abstract = {© 2018 IEEE. Engine-triggered tasks are real-time tasks that are released when the crankshaft in an engine completes a rotation, which depends on the angular speed and acceleration of the crankshaft itself. In addition, the execution time of an engine-triggered task depends on the speed of the crankshaft. Tasks whose execution times depend on a variable period are referred to as adaptive-variable rate (AVR) tasks. Existing techniques to calculate the worst-case demand of AVR tasks are either inexact or computationally intractable. In this paper, we transform the problem of finding the worst-case demand of AVR tasks over a given time interval into a variant of the knapsack problem to efficiently find the exact solution. We then propose a framework to systematically reduce the search space associated with finding the worst-case demand of AVR tasks. Experimental results reveal that our approach is at least 10 times faster, with an average runtime improvement of 146 times, for randomly generated tasksets when compared to the state-of-the-art technique.},

After a short introduction, the main electrical components of an airbag system and their interconnections are described. In the following sections, the monitoring of components external to the ECU is discussed, such as the monitoring of the battery supply voltage, the warning lamp, the selection inputs, the firing loops, and external crash sensors. For each case, requirements are stated and practical solutions for the realization of the monitoring functions are provided. Furthermore, the pros and cons of simple and sophisticated solutions are compared.},

Specific applications of this document include diagnostic, service and repair manuals, bulletins and updates, training manuals, repair data bases, underhood emission labels, and emission certification applications. This document should be used in conjunction with DAE J1930-DA Digital Annexes, which contains all of the information previously contained within the SAE J1930 tables. These documents focus on diagnostic terms applicable to electrical/electronic systems, and therefore also contains related mechanical terms, definitions, abbreviations, and acronyms. Even though the use and appropriate updating of these documents is strongly encouraged, nothing in these documents should be construed as prohibiting the introduction of a term, abbreviation, or acronym not covered by these documents. Certain terms have already been in common use and are readily understood by manufacturers and technicians, but do not strictly follow the methodology of this document. The J1930 committee may approve these terms that already may be considered industry standards. These terms fall into three categories: a Acronyms that do not logically fit the term. b Acronyms existing at the component level, i.e., their terms contain the base word or noun that describes the generic item that is being further defined. c Acronyms for terms that appear to contain the base word, but are frequently used as a modifier to another base word. (This use may possibly be thought of as following the methodology since the acronym is normally used as a modifier.)},

The project from 1945 through 1956, beginning at a time when no general-purpose, high-speed, electronic computer existed, was from the start dedicated to performance and reliability suitable for real-time control. After several shifts in objectives, Whirlwind became an experimental system for demonstrating that a digital computer could analyze the flow of radar data and generate control orders for fighter-plane interceptions of bombers. The resulting successor computers, the AN/FSQ-7, were installed in a network across the United States and Canada in the late 1950s. The SAGE System control centers were in operation about 25 years and demonstrated a 99.8\% up-time reliability. In the Whirlwind Project, vacuum tube life was raised from 500 hours to 500000 hours, marginal checking allowed the automatic detection of aging and drifting of electronic components before they reached the point of failure, random-access magnetic-core storage was invented and developed to become the industry standard computer memory for more than two decades, synchronous parallel logic was used, computer-driven cathode-ray tube displays were used for the first time, light guns were used to permit an operator to identify displayed images to the computer for action, and multiple displays were time-shared between different operators.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Designing bug-free medical device software is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices that may be used in unanticipated contexts. Safety recalls of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators due to firmware problems between 1990 and 2000 affected over 200, 000 devices. This encompasses 41\% of the devices recalled and continues to increase in frequency. There is currently no formal methodology or open experimental platform to validate and verify the correct operation of medical device software. To this effect, a real-time Virtual Heart Model (VHM) has been developed to model the electrophysiological operation of the functioning (i.e. during normal sinus rhythm) and malfunctioning (i.e. during arrhythmia) heart. We present a methodology to construct a timed-automata model by extracting timing properties of the heart. The platform employs functional and formal interfaces for validation and verification of implantable cardiac devices. We demonstrate the VHM is capable of generating clinically-relevant response to intrinsic (i.e. premature stimuli) and external (i.e. artificial pacemaker) signals for a variety of common arrhythmias. By connecting the VHM with a pacemaker model, we are able to pace and synchronize the heart during the onset of irregular heart rhythms. The VHM has also been implemented on a hardware platform for closed-loop experimentation with existing and virtual medical devices. This integrated functional and formal device design approach has potential to help expedite medical device certification for safe operation.},

	abstract = {Engine control applications include software tasks that are triggered at predetermined angular values of the crankshaft, thus generating a computational workload that varies with the engine speed. To avoid overloads at high rotation speeds, these tasks are implemented to self adapt and reduce their computational demand by switching mode at given rotation speeds. For this reason, they are referred to as adaptive variable rate (AVR) tasks. Although a few works have been proposed in the literature to model and analyze the schedulability of such a peculiar type of tasks, an exact analysis of engine control applications has been derived only for fixed priority systems, under a set of simplifying assumptions. The major problem of scheduling AVR tasks with fixed priorities, however, is that, due to engine accelerations, the interarrival period of an AVR task is subject to large variations, therefore there will be several speeds at which any fixed priority assignment is far from being optimal, significantly penalizing the schedulability of the system. This paper proposes for the first time an exact feasibility test under the Earliest Deadline First scheduling algorithm for tasks sets including regular periodic tasks and AVR tasks triggered by a common rotation source. In addition, a set of simulation results are reported to evaluate the schedulability gain achieved in this context by EDF over fixed priority scheduling.},

	title = {Performance-driven design of engine control tasks},
	abstract = {Engine control tasks include computational activities triggered at specific rotation angles of the crankshaft, making the computational load increase with the engine speed. To avoid overload at high speeds, simplified control implementations are used, defining different operational modes at different speed intervals. The design of a set of adaptive variable rate tasks is an optimization problem, consisting in determining the rotation speeds at which mode changes should occur to optimize the system performance while guaranteeing the schedulability. This paper presents three methods for tackling the optimization problem under a set of assumptions about the performance metric and the problem constraints. Two are heuristics and one is a branch and bound that is guaranteed, when it terminates, to find the optimum within a given granularity. In addition, a simple method to compute a performance upper bound is presented. The analysis of the problem reveals several insights for the design and the heuristics are shown to be quite close to the performance upper bound and the optimum with finite granularity.},
