	abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. Short-circuit faults are a potential source of damage to circuitry in DC-powered systems. Industrial applications including power converters, inverters, and insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) often rely on fault detection systems in the form of dedicated circuitry to prevent damage. To increase flexibility in short-circuit detection and decrease dedicated circuitry, a software-based approach is presented. This implementation requires minimal circuitry and allows for tradeoff between board space and processor utilization. The design relies on a single inductor and microprocessor running a real-time task for identifying current and monitoring circuitry for faults. Experiments demonstrate detection of both hard-switching faults (HSF) and fault under load (FUL) shorts. The depicted relationship between processor utilization and board space consumed by the circuitry is confirmed through experimentation and allows optimization of board space with respect to utilization and vice versa. As a result, the proposed software-based detection is implementable with the addition of a single component and protects against damage from both HSF and FUL shorts.},

To reduce the workload at high speeds, these tasks also adopt different implementations at different rotation speed intervals. However, the current studies limit to the case that the switching speeds at which task implementations should change are configured at design time. In this paper, we propose to study the task model where switching speeds are dynamically adjusted. We develop schedulability analysis techniques for such systems, including a new digraph-based task model to safely approximate the workload from software tasks triggered at predefined rotation angles. Experiments on synthetic task systems demonstrate that the proposed approach provides substantial benefits on system schedulability.},

	abstract = {© 2018 IEEE. Engine-triggered tasks are real-time tasks that are released when the crankshaft in an engine completes a rotation, which depends on the angular speed and acceleration of the crankshaft itself. In addition, the execution time of an engine-triggered task depends on the speed of the crankshaft. Tasks whose execution times depend on a variable period are referred to as adaptive-variable rate (AVR) tasks. Existing techniques to calculate the worst-case demand of AVR tasks are either inexact or computationally intractable. In this paper, we transform the problem of finding the worst-case demand of AVR tasks over a given time interval into a variant of the knapsack problem to efficiently find the exact solution. We then propose a framework to systematically reduce the search space associated with finding the worst-case demand of AVR tasks. Experimental results reveal that our approach is at least 10 times faster, with an average runtime improvement of 146 times, for randomly generated tasksets when compared to the state-of-the-art technique.},

In the partially ordered knapsack problem we wish to find a maximum-valued subset of vertices whose total weight does not exceed a given knapsack capacity, and which contains every predecessor of a vertex if it contains the vertex itself. We consider the special case where G is an out-tree. Even though this special case is still NP-complete, we observe how dynamic programming techniques can be used to construct pseudopolynomial time optimization algorithms and fully polynomial time approximation schemes for it. In particular, we show that a nonstandard approach we call "left-right" dynamic programming is better suited for this problem than the standard "bottom-up" approach, and we show how this "left-right" approach can also be adapted to the case of in-trees and to a related tree partitioning problem arising in integrated circuit design. We conclude by presenting complexity results which indicate that similar success cannot be expected with either problem when the restriction to trees is lifted.},

In this paper, we present a new hardware-software system, called Software Defined Battery (SDB), which allows system designers to integrate batteries of different chemistries. SDB exposes APIs to the operating system which control the amount of charge flowing in and out of each battery, enabling it to dynamically trade one battery property for another depending on Application And/Or User Needs. Using microbenchmarks from our prototype SDB implementation, and through detailed simulations, we demonstrate that it is possible to combine batteries which individually excel along different axes to deliver an enhanced collective performance when compared to traditional battery packs.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCPS.2012.14},
	abstract = {Traditional mechanical subsystems in automobiles are being replaced by electronically controlled systems, often with no mechanical backup. This trend towards "drive-by-wire" systems is becoming increasingly popular. In these cyber-physical systems, a critical task not meeting its timing deadline can lead to a safety violation and damage to life and/or property. Classical real-time scheduling techniques such as RMS and EDF can be used to guarantee the schedulability of periodic tasks. However, certain critical tasks like the engine control task are activated by engine events such as pulses generated by sensors at the engine crankshaft. The periods of these engine tasks vary continually and even dramatically depending on the engine speed. The conventional periodic task model is inadequate for handling such tasks in cyber-physical systems due to its pessimism when combined with common schedulability analyses. In this paper, we define a new task model called Rhythmic Tasks for tasks having periods that vary due to external physical events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that considers continually varying periods for fixed-priority scheduling in dynamic operating environments. We formally define the rhythmic task model and study its scheduling properties. In the context of rhythmic engine control tasks, we offer schedulability tests for determining the maximum possible utilization under the steady state, which is related to the physical engine speed. We also investigate the range of possible engine acceleration and deceleration rates. We show that excessive acceleration and deceleration can make the system unschedulable. We provide algorithms to find the appropriate ranges for acceleration and deceleration rates. We use a specific case study of engine control to illustrate our analysis.},

We study two types of fixed-priority scheduling in mode change systems: task-level and mode-level fixed-priority scheduling. The proposed tests run in polynomial time. We further show that a utilization of 2-√2 ≈ 0.5857 can be guaranteed in implicit-deadline multi-mode systems if each mode is prioritized according to rate-monotonic policy.

	abstract = {Software designed to function in a hard-real-time environment where strict timing constraints must be met often entails implicit assumptions about a programming language and the underlying system which supports it. Programs which are logically correct, i.e., they implement the intended algorithms, may not function correctly if their assumed timing characteristics of the software or if the expressible timing characteristics cannot be verified before run time. For distributed systems in particular, the software must be tailored to a myriad of implementation parameters, e.g., communication bandwidth, thus rendering subsequent modifications hazardous. Our research investigates the basic problems in automating the design and maintenance of hard real-time software. After examining the limitations of the traditional approach to real-time software design via process-based models, we shall provide a graph-based computation model which is more suitable for expressing the computation requirements of the real-time environment. This model is an extension of CONSORT (Control Structure Optimized for Real-Time), an experimental software design system which has been implemented to generate process control application programs from block diagram schemata. While our graph-based model is abstract, it can serve as a useful intermediate representation between textual requirements specifications and target application programs. Using the graph-based model, the complexity of the relevant resource allocation problems for meeting stringent timing constraints is investigated.},

	abstract = {The adaptive varying-rate (AVR) task model has been proposed as a means of modeling certain physically-derived constraints in CPS's in a manner that is more accurate (less pessimistic) than is possible using prior task models from real-time scheduling theory. Existing work on schedulabil- ity analysis of systems of AVR tasks is primarily restricted to fixed-priority scheduling; this paper establishes schedu- lability analysis results for systems of AVR and sporadic tasks under Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling. The proposed analysis techniques are evaluated both theoretically via the speedup factor metric, and experimentally via schedulability experiments on randomly-generated task systems.},

This paper is focused on the specific needs of monitoring circuitry in electronic control units (ECU) for airbag systems. After a short introduction, the main electrical components of an airbag system and their interconnections are described. In the following sections, the monitoring of components external to the ECU is discussed, such as the monitoring of the battery supply voltage, the warning lamp, the selection inputs, the firing loops, and external crash sensors. For each case, requirements are stated and practical solutions for the realization of the monitoring functions are provided. Furthermore, the pros and cons of simple and sophisticated solutions are compared.},

Certain terms have already been in common use and are readily understood by manufacturers and technicians, but do not strictly follow the methodology of this document. The J1930 committee may approve these terms that already may be considered industry standards. These terms fall into three categories: a Acronyms that do not logically fit the term. b Acronyms existing at the component level, i.e., their terms contain the base word or noun that describes the generic item that is being further defined. c Acronyms for terms that appear to contain the base word, but are frequently used as a modifier to another base word.

The project from 1945 through 1956, beginning at a time when no general-purpose, high-speed, electronic computer existed, was from the start dedicated to performance and reliability suitable for real-time control. After several shifts in objectives, Whirlwind became an experimental system for demonstrating that a digital computer could analyze the flow of radar data and generate control orders for fighter-plane interceptions of bombers. The resulting successor computers, the AN/FSQ-7, were installed in a network across the United States and Canada in the late 1950s. The SAGE System control centers were in operation about 25 years and demonstrated a 99.8\% up-time reliability. In the Whirlwind Project, vacuum tube life was raised from 500 hours to 500000 hours, marginal checking allowed the automatic detection of aging and drifting of electronic components before they reached the point of failure, random-access magnetic-core storage was invented and developed to become the industry standard computer memory for more than two decades, synchronous parallel logic was used, computer-driven cathode-ray tube displays were used for the first time, light guns were used to permit an operator to identify displayed images to the computer for action, and multiple displays were time-shared between different operators.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1109/ECRTS.2010.36},
	abstract = {Designing bug-free medical device software is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices that may be used in unanticipated contexts. Safety recalls of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators due to firmware problems between 1990 and 2000 affected over 200, 000 devices. This encompasses 41\% of the devices recalled and continues to increase in frequency. There is currently no formal methodology or open experimental platform to validate and verify the correct operation of medical device software. To this effect, a real-time Virtual Heart Model (VHM) has been developed to model the electrophysiological operation of the functioning (i.e. during normal sinus rhythm) and malfunctioning (i.e. during arrhythmia) heart. We present a methodology to construct a timed-automata model by extracting timing properties of the heart. The platform employs functional and formal interfaces for validation and verification of implantable cardiac devices. We demonstrate the VHM is capable of generating clinically-relevant response to intrinsic (i.e. premature stimuli) and external (i.e. artificial pacemaker) signals for a variety of common arrhythmias. By connecting the VHM with a pacemaker model, we are able to pace and synchronize the heart during the onset of irregular heart rhythms. The VHM has also been implemented on a hardware platform for closed-loop experimentation with existing and virtual medical devices. This integrated functional and formal device design approach has potential to help expedite medical device certification for safe operation.},

	abstract = {Chemical dosing is a significant process of water treatment system because it influences on water quality and operational cost. This paper presents a chemical dosing pH control using temporal logic technique for ultrafiltration water treatment system, in order to validate and analyze an appropriate control approach. In this study, a simulation was built in Matlab Simulink, and has been tested with the data collected from a pilot-scale ultrafiltration water treatment system. As stated in the simulation results, the proposed control scheme can achieve the performance specification in pH control.},

	abstract = {The problem of multiprogram scheduling on a single processor is studied from the viewpoint of the characteristics peculiar to the program functions that need guaranteed service. It is shown that an optimum fixed priority scheduler possesses an upper bound to processor utilization which may be as low as 70 percent for large task sets. It is also shown that full processor utilization can be achieved by dynamically assigning priorities on the basis of their current deadlines. A combination of these two scheduling techniques is also discussed.},
