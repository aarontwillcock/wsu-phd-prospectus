\section{Conclusion}   \label{chap:conclusion}

Autonomous vehicles, cyber physical systems, edge computing, internet of things, and smart infrastructure are the fronteir of modern computing.
The success of applications in each of these domains rests upon correct and timely execution by processors and microcontrollers alike.
As hardware and software become ever more integrated, the providing real-time guarantees becomes increasingly complicated.
Fortunately, this integration provides as many opportunities as it does challenges.
In this work, we address several ways in which the connection between physical system dynamics, like current and engine speed, and real-time task parameters, like WCET and interarrival time, can be leveraged to reduce the complexity of demand characterization and schedulability.
This work also highlights how the connections between physical and real-time systems can be used for codesign and, most importantly, to allow advancements at either end of the relationship to benefit the other.
