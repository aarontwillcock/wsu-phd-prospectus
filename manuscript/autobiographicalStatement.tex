I am a Ph.D. student in Wayne State University's Department of Computer Science with a focus in real-time systems and a minor in Mechanical Engineering.
I help advance real-time, safety-critical systems through research
and facilitate robotics education through mentorship for K-12 students.
In the past, I've provided education in computer science ethics through university teaching,
designed, manufactured, and serviced control systems for competitive robots,
and volunteered at local high school robotics competitions.
