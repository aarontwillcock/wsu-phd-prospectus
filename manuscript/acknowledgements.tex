\begin{center}
No words will sufficiently describe the gratitude I have for Professor Nathan Fisher's guidance in these years of study and self-development.
Without his mentorship, patience, and support, this work would not be possible and I would not be the person I am today.

I'm deeply indebted to Professor Tam Chantem for her persistent support and feedback - especially from so far away.
I'm very grateful for the many hours of discussion and guidance on writing, collaboration, and our work together.

Special thanks is also owed to the colleagues, mentors, and teachers outside of academia who taught me to teach, to speak publicly, and to never stop asking questions:

Mrs. Stafford,
Kelly Kozlowski,
and Mr. Arscheene.

I would also like to acknowledge all of my students, especially Blitz Creek and the ThunderChickens, for the opportunity to mentor and teach.
It is your desire to learn, break things, and build them again that makes learning and teaching exciting - every day.

This work was also supported, in part, by the United States National Science Foundation
(CNS Grant Nos. 0953585, 1205338, 1618185 \& 1618979) and Wayne State University's Thomas C. Rumble Graduate Fellowship Program.
