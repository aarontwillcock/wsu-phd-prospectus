\subsection{Contributions}

The main contributions of this work are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a hardware-software codesign approach for software-based short-circuit detection that demonstrates the tradeoff of processor utilization under EDF against inductor size (and thus board space consumed by circuitry) and
    \item a demand characterization method for Adaptive Variable-Rate (AVR) tasks used in Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) in which engine dynamics are used to limit the search space for the Demand Bound Function (DBF).
\end{enumerate}
