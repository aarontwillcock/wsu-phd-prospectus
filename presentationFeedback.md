1. Make a few slides, results mostly done

31 

High Level:
1. Contributions - Physical Domains
   1. Break down by dynamics
   2. give overview high level - first sln in software
   3. say presented for MS so we focus on engine control
   4. talk about high level of engine control comparison
2. Tie in thesis at end with future work
   1. give intuition for how MAE ties in
   2. focus on tying in DARTs
3. Time is fine

Low Level:
1. Can reduce if needed
2. Slide 6 - Say simple test is DBF < t forall t
3. Slide 13 - rm comma - rm from prospectus
4. Slide 17 - rm holiday theivery
5. Slide 25 - "reduce ALGORITHM RUNTIME"
6. Slide 31 - "some focus on constant accel, we focus on var." - spend more time on rhs
7. Slide 40 - "only non-decreasing sequences considered"
8. Slide 46 - "What have we done? We've est. 3 properties of identifying dominant sequence. Now we will explain how to find the dominant sequence"
9. Smooth out empirical section.
10. Engine control - Did you apply on real engine? - Buttle slides, Groups like biondi got data from continental that are proprietary 

Invite ppl in lab.
Email forms, slides beforehand.
